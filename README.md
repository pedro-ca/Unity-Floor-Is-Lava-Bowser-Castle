# Introduction
3D platform game where you control the Mario-ball! Collect coins, find secrets, die (a lot) and reach the end of the terrifying Bowser's Castle!

This is part of the Unity Essentials tutorial, but I got TOTALLY carried away and turned a 30 minutes project into a 2 month one.
This is my first real finished game. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it.

# Where to Play it
You can play it online with the [WebGL version on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-410425), the [WebGL version on Itch.io](https://pedrokadev.itch.io/floor-is-lava-bowser-castle) or download the [Windows .EXE build](https://github.com/pedro-ca/Unity-Floor-Is-Lava-Bowser-Castle/releases) for better performance.

# Commands
- W,A,S,D to move.
- Space to jump
- R to commit die

# Additional Info
- There are 4 secret areas with Easter eggs around the level. Some might be... questionable to say the least.
- The beach balls don't do nothing btw. They are just a far away memory of when this project was just a physics tech demo.
- There is a known bug where sometimes the player makes a hyperjump. [Still needs to be fixed](https://github.com/pedro-ca/Unity-Floor-Is-Lava-Bowser-Castle/issues/1).
