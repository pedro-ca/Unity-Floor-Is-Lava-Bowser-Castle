# Introduction
3D platform game where you control the Mario-ball! Collect coins, find secrets, die (a lot) and reach the end of the terrifying Bowser's Castle!

This is part of the Unity Essentials tutorial, but I got TOTALLY carried away and turned a 30 minutes project into a 2 month one.
This is my first real finished game. I hope you have as much fun playing it as I had making it.

# Commands:
- W,A,S,D to move.
- Space to jump
- R to commit die

# Additional Info:
- You can play it online with the [WebGL version on Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-410425) or download the [Windows .exe build]([https://github.com/pedro-ca/Unity-Floor-Is-Lava-Bowser-Castle/releases/tag/winx64v1.0](https://github.com/pedro-ca/Unity-Floor-Is-Lava-Bowser-Castle/releases))(for better performance)
- There are 4 secret areas with Easter eggs around the level. Some might be... questionable to say the least.
- The beach balls don't do nothing btw. They are just a far away memory of when this project was just a physics tech demo.
- There is a known bug where sometimes the player makes a hyperjump. Still needs to be fixed (https://github.com/pedro-ca/Unity-Floor-Is-Lava-Bowser-Castle/issues/1)
